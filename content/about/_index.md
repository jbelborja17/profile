title: "About Me"
---

I am a **Senior Software Engineer** with professional experience since 2005, currently focused on **adopting Artificial Intelligence across the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** to improve engineering productivity, software quality, and delivery effectiveness.

My background is centered on **backend and platform engineering**, with deep expertise in **JVM ecosystems (Java, Kotlin)** and solid experience in **TypeScript**. I design and evolve production-grade systems using **clean and hexagonal architectures**, applying **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles in both monolithic and distributed (microservices) environments.

I have extensive hands-on experience with **AWS**, working across cloud-native services, **Infrastructure as Code**, and **event-driven architectures**. I have designed and operated **workflow-based systems** using **Temporal** and **AWS Step Functions**, always with a strong focus on reliability, scalability, and operability.

On the data side, I have worked with both **relational databases** (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and **NoSQL solutions** (DynamoDB), choosing persistence models based on domain and system requirements rather than trends.

I maintain a strong **production and delivery mindset**, with solid experience in **automated testing**, **continuous delivery**, and **DevOps practices**. I care deeply about building systems that are maintainable, observable, and aligned with real business needs.

Outside of day-to-day engineering, I enjoy evolving engineering practices, mentoring other engineers, and exploring how AI can be applied responsibly and effectively to modern software development.
